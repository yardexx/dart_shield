# This is a sample configuration file for dart_shield.
# ⚠️ Configuration file must be named `shield_options.yaml` and placed in the root of the project.

# shield_options.yaml is file with structure similar to analysis_options.yaml and it defines the
#  rules that dart_shield will use to analyze your code.

# The `shield` key is required.
shield:

  # List of excluded files or directories from being analyzed
  exclude:
    # Exclude a file using path (path begins at the root of the project):
    - 'lib/ignored.dart'
    # Globs are also supported
    - '**.g.dart'

  # List of rules that dart_shield will use to analyze your code
  rules:
    - prefer-https-over-http

  # Some rules need more fine-tuning and are marked as experimental.
  # You can enable them by setting `enable-experimental` to `true`.
  enable-experimental: true

  # List of experimental rules that dart_shield will use to analyze your code
  # ⚠️ Experimental rules are subject to change and may not be as stable as regular rules.
  # ⚠️ Using "experimental-rules" without setting "enable-experimental" to "true" will cause an error.
