# Features

dart_shield can currently detect the following security issues in your Dart code:

- Weak hashing algorithms
- Usage of non-secure random number generators
- Hardcoded URLs
- Usage of insecure HTTP connections

It ain't much, but it's honest work. More features are planned for the future.
