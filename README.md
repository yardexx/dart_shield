# Overview

dart_shield CLI is heavily inspired by other Dart and Flutter CLI, so commands and their behaviour
is similar to what you might expect.

# Features

`dart_shield` can detect the following security issues:

- Hardcoded API keys
- Hardcoded URLs
- Weak hashing algorithms
- Usage of non-secure random number generators
- Usage of insecure HTTP connections

# Installation

> **Note:** dart_shield is not yet available on pub.dev.

To install dart_shield, run the following command:

```bash
dart pub global activate -s git https://github.com/yardexx/dart_shield
```

# Usage

dart_shield contains two crucial commands:

- `init` - Initializes dart_shield in your project.
- `analyze` - Analyzes your Dart code for potential security flaws.

To initialize `dart_shield` in your project, run the following command:

```bash
dart_shield init
```

This command creates a `shield_options.yaml` file in the root of your project. This file contains
the configuration for `dart_shield`, which will be used during the analysis (similar to
`analysis_options.yaml`).

If a shield_options.yaml file already exists in your project and you want to recreate it, use the
`-f` or `--force` flag:

```bash
dart_shield init -f
# or
dart_shield init --force
```

To analyze your Dart code for potential security flaws, run the following command,
specifying the directory:

```bash
dart_shield analyze .
```

> **Note:** The . at the end of the command specifies the directory to be analyzed and must always
> be included. The command does not automatically add it.

This command analyzes your Dart code based on the configuration in the shield_options.yaml file.
If the configuration file is not found, the command will fail.

# Configuration

The `shield_options.yaml` file contains configuration options, primarily rules, for `dart_shield`.
The configuration is similar to the `analysis_options.yaml` file, making it familiar to those who
have
used Dart analysis tools.

Example of the `shield_options.yaml` file:

```yaml
# This is a sample configuration file for dart_shield.
# ‚ö†Ô∏è Configuration file must be named `shield_options.yaml` and placed in the root of the project.

# shield_options.yaml is file with structure similar to analysis_options.yaml and it defines the
#  rules that dart_shield will use to analyze your code.

# The `shield` key is required.
shield:

  # List of excluded files or directories from being analyzed
  exclude:
    # Exclude a file using path (path begins at the root of the project):
    - 'lib/ignored.dart'
    # Globs are also supported
    - '**.g.dart'

  # List of rules that dart_shield will use to analyze your code
  rules:
    - prefer-https-over-http
    - avoid-hardcoded-secrets

  # Some rules need more fine-tuning and are marked as experimental.
  # You can enable them by setting `enable-experimental` to `true`.
  enable-experimental: true

  # List of experimental rules that dart_shield will use to analyze your code
  # ‚ö†Ô∏è Experimental rules are subject to change and may not be as stable as regular rules.
  # ‚ö†Ô∏è Using "experimental-rules" without setting "enable-experimental" to "true" will cause an error.
  experimental-rules:
    - avoid-hardcoded-urls
    - avoid-weak-hashing
    - prefer-secure-random
```

# Rules

dart_shield includes a set of predefined rules to analyze Dart code for potential security flaws,
similar to how linter rules enforce code style.

## List of rules

- avoid-hardcoded-secrets: Detects hardcoded secrets, such as API keys and passwords.
- avoid-hardcoded-urls: Detects hardcoded URLs.
- prefer-https-over-http: Detects the use of insecure HTTP connections.
- avoid-weak-hashing: Detects the use of weak hashing algorithms, such as MD5 and SHA-1.
- prefer-secure-random: Detects the use of non-secure random number generators.

# Contributing

This project is still under construction, so contributions might be limited. However, one of the
main goals of this project is to provide a free, open-source tool for the community, emphasizing
the importance of security accessibility.

Once the project is production-ready, contributions will be welcome.

If you have any ideas, suggestions, or wish to contribute, feel free to open an issue.
